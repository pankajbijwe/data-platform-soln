Building production-grade AWS architecture capable of handling gigabytes of data and sustaining 5000 transactions per second (TPS), 

Key focus areas
- Scalable compute and storage
- Security controls (IAM, encryption, VPC)
- Operational controls (logging, monitoring)
- Cost optimization (auto-scaling, spot instances, lifecycle policies

Architecture Overview
- Layer | AWS Services Used 
- Compute | Amazon ECS with Fargate or EKS (for containerized workloads), Lambda (for async) 
- Storage | Amazon S3 (raw data), DynamoDB or Aurora (high TPS), EFS (shared state) 
- Networking | VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, ALB, Security Groups 
- Security | IAM Roles/Policies, KMS, Secrets Manager, GuardDuty 
- Observability | CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudTrail, AWS Config 
- Cost Optimization | Auto Scaling, Spot Instances, S3 Lifecycle, Savings Plans 

Kye considerations - 
1. Scalable Compute with ECS + Fargate or EC2
- Use EC2-backed ECS for fine-grained control over CPU/memory and burst capacity.
- Auto Scaling Groups with target tracking on CPU or custom CloudWatch metrics.
- Task concurrency tuning: Increase desired_count, and use ulimits and maxConnections in container config

2. High-Throughput Data Ingestion
- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams or Amazon MSK (Kafka) for ingesting gigabytes of data per second.
- Use Kinesis Firehose to buffer and batch-write to S3, Redshift, or OpenSearch

3. Optimized Storage
- Amazon S3 for raw data (multi-GB scale), with lifecycle policies and intelligent tiering.
- Amazon DynamoDB for ultra-low-latency TPS workloads:
- Use On-Demand mode or Provisioned with Auto Scaling
- Enable DAX for in-memory acceleration
- 
4. Network Optimization
- Use Private Subnets with NAT Gateways for secure outbound traffic.
- Enable VPC Endpoints for S3, DynamoDB, and Secrets Manager to reduce latency and cost.
- Consider Elastic Load Balancer (ALB) with path-based routing and sticky sessions.

5. Secrets & Configuration
- Store DB credentials, API keys, and config in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.
- Use IAM Task Roles with least privilege access.

6. Observability & Resilience
- CloudWatch Logs + Metrics + Alarms for ECS, Kinesis, DynamoDB, and custom app metrics.
- Enable X-Ray for distributed tracing across services.
- Use Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) for Kinesis or SQS to handle failures gracefully.

7. Performance Tuning
- Tune container JVMs, thread pools, and connection pools.
- Use multi-threaded consumers for Kinesis or Kafka.
- Batch writes to DynamoDB and S3 to reduce API call overhead.
